## Git vs. GitHub

**Git:** Git is all about snapshots. Git allows users to monitor their progress through the command line, where commands will be given. Think of git as a photo op where you can add, take snapshots of and remove people (in this case content) at will. 

**Github:** Github is entirely reliant on git. Github is the cloud-based storage platform which can store various forms of code.

## Initial Setup
* To sign up for github, first go to [the github website](https://github.com/), then follow all the steps necessary to create a profile (if you are an HSTAT student use your HSTAT email).

    4. On the SSH keys tab, there is a 2nd SSH key (it should begin with ssh-rsa). Copy that and then paste it into github.

    * Change directories (**cd**) into the repo and type **git init**. DO NOT  GIT INIT IN YOUR WORKSPACE (but if you do, there's a fix). 
    * Create
