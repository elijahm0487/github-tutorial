## Git vs. GitHub

**Git:** Git is all about snapshots. Git allows users to monitor their progress through the command line, where commands will be given. Think of git as a photo op where you can add, take snapshots of and remove people (in this case content) at will. 

**Github:** Github is entirely reliant on git. Github is the cloud-based storage platform which can store various forms of code.
